Arduino
=======

This is my repository for sharing my Arduino workspace. I don't create a repo 
for each project because that's to much work... ;)

I will describe my projects here some time... maybe...

All my code is provided to you under the terms of the GPL license version 2. Be
carefull when using my code because there are libraries included which my be
available using a different license then mine. Be sure, everything is open 
source and freely available but before copying some stuff to your project read
the terms of use of used libraries.

Have fun with this!

P.S.: I share this on GitHub mostly for sharing across my devices so don't 
wonder about crazy stuff... :)
